# react-wordcloud-plus

This package is a fork of [react-wordcloud](https://github.com/chrisrzhou/react-wordcloud) by Chris Zhou.

## Why this fork?

The original package hasn't been updated since August 2020 and doesn't officially support React 18 or ESM modules. This fork adds:

1. **React 18 Support**: Updated to work with React 18's new rendering engine and event system
2. **ESM Module Support**: Added proper ESM module exports for modern JavaScript environments
3. **Updated Dependencies**: All dependencies have been updated to their latest versions
4. **TypeScript Improvements**: Enhanced TypeScript definitions for better type safety

## Acknowledgments

All credit for the original implementation goes to Chris Zhou and the contributors to the original react-wordcloud package. This fork builds upon their excellent work to provide continued support for modern React applications.

## Differences from the original

- Package name changed to `react-wordcloud-plus`
- Updated peer dependencies to include React 17 and 18
- Added ESM module support
- Updated all dependencies to latest versions
- Fixed event handling for React 18
- Improved TypeScript definitions
